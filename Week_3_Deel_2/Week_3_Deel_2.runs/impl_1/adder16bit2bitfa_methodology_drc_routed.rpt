2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.248 ns between B_FF/generate_ff[2].gen_ff0/generate_ff[0].ff0/Q_reg/C (clocked by sysclk) and S_FF/generate_ff[13].ff0/Q_reg/D (clocked by sysclk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.594 ns between B_FF/generate_ff[2].gen_ff0/generate_ff[0].ff0/Q_reg/C (clocked by sysclk) and S_FF/generate_ff[14].ff0/Q_reg/D (clocked by sysclk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.883 ns between B_FF/generate_ff[2].gen_ff0/generate_ff[0].ff0/Q_reg/C (clocked by sysclk) and S_FF/generate_ff[15].ff0/Q_reg/D (clocked by sysclk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.015 ns between B_FF/generate_ff[2].gen_ff0/generate_ff[0].ff0/Q_reg/C (clocked by sysclk) and CO_FF/Q_reg/D (clocked by sysclk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
